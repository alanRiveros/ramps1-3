solid edge v19
academic license

caller is working on an open source project involves designing a machine all work done using solid edge v19 academic

open source project is non profit making has people contributing all around the world everyone is working for free doing the work in their spare time

to progress the design they want to distribute the solid edge data to other contributors to work on, who would then return the data at a later time

***

is there any issue with sending the data to 3rd parties and have them develop the designs further? (obviously the 3rd parties would also need to be using solid edge v19 academic in order to access the data)

or would this violate the usage agreement they have signed up to?...

If all you are sending, is your data produced in Solid Edge, then this is fine. All we say is the academic application/license should not be used for commercial purposes and should not be distributed.
