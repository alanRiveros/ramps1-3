This release includes solid model files for all of the parts (see list of formats below for more info), as well as the STLs for all printed parts.

Some minor re-structuring has gone on since the last release: 

- Assembly files have been included, a level above the part files. Full assembly is "Darwin 1-0-6" in both SolidEdge and STEP formats.
- Nozzle wipe designs are now included (\Printed-parts\"Wiper-X")
- "x-square-jig" is now in \Printed-parts\Moulds-and-jigs
- "Extruder-quickfit-dock" & "Extruder-quickfit-latch" have been removed with the intention of including it in the next extruder release. If you're reading this before the next extruder release please refer to v1.0.5 for these two part files.
- "Z-tensioner..." files have been remodelled and renamed. If you prefer the previous release design (1.0.5), feel free to use that instead.
- MS Excel version of my BOM is also included for your convenience, however, you are reminded that this may not exactly represent your final configuration - everyboy's varies slightly ;-)
- Some Imported-part STLs have been renamed to match model filenames. New Imported-part STLs have also been included to match all the model files.
- Whilst "handmade-parts.pdf" has been included, its pictoral glossary of the printed parts may not reflect recent additions/mods.
